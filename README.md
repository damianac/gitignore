## Need predefined .gitignore file?
 Check out .gitignore file in this project. It'll serve well for most of the projects.
## There's something missing in your .gitignore file
  Yeah, lots of things are missing. Even though it has lots of lines of codes, it doesn't cover everything and it mainly serves for personal use. If you want to see more things added in the list, feel free to open issue and I'll add it.
